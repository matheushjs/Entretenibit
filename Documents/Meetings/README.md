File Name Conventions
---

I've been following the convention:

```
[#]-[DATE]-[TYPE]-[PLACE].[EXTENSION]
```

Where:

- `#` is a sequential ID, given to files sequentially in the order of their creation.

- `DATE` is the date when the file was created or when the event ocurred.

- `TYPE` is the event itself, like *meeting* for our group meetings, or *interview_planning*.

- `PLACE` is an optional indication of the place where the meeting happened.
